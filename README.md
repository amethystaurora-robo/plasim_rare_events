## Applying Rare Event Sampling to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) Run

This research applies a rare event algorithm which uses cloning and killing (more below) to force the system towards a collapsed state. The algorithm is applied to the Global Climate Model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, PlaSim, to allow for improved accuracy of results as compared to the Gottwald model, but to save on computational cost when compared with other models.
